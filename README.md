Analyzing Video Game User Data with Pandas 
------------------------------------------
Observable Trends:
1) In regards to the purchasing analysis by age, as purchase count increased amongst the age groups so tit total purchase value
2) In regards to the 5 top spenders listed, average purchase price and Total Purchase value did not seem to be directly correlated 
3) The Item "Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm" was both the most purchased and the highest grossing item in the game
